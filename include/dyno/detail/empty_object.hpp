// Hack to get an instance of an empty type that is not default constructible,
// while still satisfying the C++ standard. None of this would be necessary if
// stateless lambdas were default constructible.
//
// The idea behind this trick is that we make two layout-compatible types `T1`
// and `T2`, while having `T2` inherit from the empty class `T` we're trying
// to bypass the construction of.
//
// We then create a union of these two types, and initialize `T1` inside that
// union. Since `T1` and `T2` are layout-compatible, we can legally access the
// `T2` member of the union, which we can then legally cast to its base class
// `T`. Et voil√†, we've got a valid `T` object, yet we've never initialized it.
//
// For details on standard layout types, see:
// http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/data_members#Standard_layout
